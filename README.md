My Experience:

This certificate highlights my 87 hours of hands-on experience across a wide range of programs, focusing on real-world blue team triaging scenarios. I applied the MITRE ATT&CK Framework, utilized the Cisco Talos Intelligence platform, VirusTotal platform, and many MANY other OSINT tools to support my investigations — amazing!

Among the many tools and challenges covered, some of my favorites included stopping an active brute-force attack with Snort, using Wireshark to investigate network abnormalities, incident handling with Splunk/SIEM’s, and investigating suspicious phishing email source codes with Thunderbird and Volatility3. 
These experiences finally satisfied my itching curiosity on how to effectively discover and mitigate these types of cyber threats!
