My Experience:

As part of my ongoing journey in Cybersecurity, Iâ€™ve completed the Cisco Networking Academy: Endpoint Security certification. This course provided hands-on experience and in-depth knowledge regarding endpoint protection, malware analysis, and securing endpoints against cyber threats.

Key Takeaways:

**Endpoint Protection:** Gained an understanding of endpoint security methods, including antivirus, firewalls, and intrusion detection.

**Threat Analysis:** Learned how to assess security risks and implement controls to mitigate endpoint vulnerabilities.

**Security Best Practices:** Acquired practical skills to safeguard endpoints from various attack vectors, including malware, ransomware, and phishing.

This certification complements my work in the SOC Analyst training repository by enhancing my understanding of endpoint security, which is crucial for identifying and responding to threats in a Security Operations Center (SOC).
